\begin{abstract}
An article usually includes an abstract, a concise summary of the work
covered at length in the main body of the article. 
\begin{description}
\item[Usage]
Secondary publications and information retrieval purposes.
\item[Structure]
You may use the \texttt{description} environment to structure your abstract;
use the optional argument of the \verb+\item+ command to give the category of each item. 
\end{description}
\end{abstract}

\section{\label{sec:level1}First-level heading:\protect\\ The line
break was forced \lowercase{via} \textbackslash\textbackslash}

This sample document demonstrates proper use of REV\TeX~4.2 (and
\LaTeXe) in mansucripts prepared for submission to APS
journals. Further information can be found in the REV\TeX~4.2
documentation included in the distribution or available at
\url{http://journals.aps.org/revtex/}.

When commands are referred to in this example file, they are always
shown with their required arguments, using normal \TeX{} format. In
this format, \verb+#1+, \verb+#2+, etc. stand for required
author-supplied arguments to commands. For example, in
\verb+\section{#1}+ the \verb+#1+ stands for the title text of the
author's section heading, and in \verb+\title{#1}+ the \verb+#1+
stands for the title text of the paper.

Line breaks in section headings at all levels can be introduced using
\textbackslash\textbackslash. A blank input line tells \TeX\ that the
paragraph has ended. Note that top-level section headings are
automatically uppercased. If a specific letter or word should appear in
lowercase instead, you must escape it using \verb+\lowercase{#1}+ as
in the word ``via'' above.

\subsection{\label{sec:level2}Second-level heading: Formatting}

This file may be formatted in either the \texttt{preprint} or
\texttt{reprint} style. \texttt{reprint} format mimics final journal output. 
Either format may be used for submission purposes. \texttt{letter} sized paper should
be used when submitting to APS journals.
